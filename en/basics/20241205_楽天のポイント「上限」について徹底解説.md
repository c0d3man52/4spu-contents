## Rakuten Points Have Two Key Caps to Watch Out For!

It may come as a surprise, but Rakuten Points have earning caps based on how you earn them. In fact, most points come with some kind of cap.

For example, under Rakuten SPU, the only point category without a cap is:

1. Rakuten Card Base Points

All other bonus point categories have specific caps.

Rakuten Points are subject to two main types of limits:

1. Total Points Earned
2. Earning Period

### Total Points Earned

This cap represents the maximum additional points you can earn for a specific point multiplier.

For instance, Rakuten SPU’s bonus for Rakuten Mobile members is +4x, but the earning cap is 2,000 points. This means 2,000 points represent 4% of a purchase amount of 50,000 yen (55,000 yen with tax). If you spend more than 55,001 yen (tax included), *your effective return rate decreases from 4%.*

### Earning Period

The earning period determines the timeframe during which points are calculated and is closely tied to the total points cap.

Rakuten Points are typically calculated over two main periods:

1. Monthly Periods
2. Event Periods

Rakuten SPU is generally calculated on a monthly basis, whereas events like the Shopping Marathon are calculated within the event's active period.

For example, the Rakuten SPU bonus for Rakuten Mobile members is capped at 2,000 points per month. Once you exceed this cap, the +4% bonus no longer applies for additional purchases that month.

On the other hand, Shopping Marathon events are usually held twice a month, and each event is calculated separately. This means you can earn up to the maximum limit during each event.

## Key Spending Thresholds for Rakuten Point Caps

When using Rakuten Points, the critical spending threshold to keep in mind is 50,000 yen (55,000 yen with tax).

### If Your Monthly Rakuten Purchases Are Under 50,000 Yen

For light users who spend less than 50,000 yen per month on Rakuten, you are unlikely to hit the point caps and generally don’t need to worry much about them.

However, note that some shop-specific promotions or campaigns may have much lower caps, so be cautious.

### If Your Monthly Rakuten Purchases Exceed 50,000 Yen

If you spend over 50,000 yen monthly, you’ll need to pay close attention to point caps, especially under Rakuten SPU, as your effective discount rate will decrease.

The following are some key bonus categories with a 55,000-yen cap (tax included):

| Benefit                          | Base Rate | Period    | Point Cap | Spending Cap |
|:---------------------------------|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:------------:|
| Rakuten Mobile Member            | +4%       | Monthly   | 2,000 pt  | ¥55,000      |
| Rakuten Mobile Carrier Payment   | +2%       | Monthly   | 1,000 pt  | ¥55,000      |
| Rakuten Turbo / Rakuten Hikari   | +2%       | Monthly   | 1,000 pt  | ¥55,000      |

These three categories cap out quickly for regular Rakuten shoppers.

If you are using the Shopping Marathon to maximize your discounts, be aware that exceeding the 55,000-yen cap for these bonuses will result in fewer points than expected.

### If You Spend Over 77,000 Yen Per Event on Rakuten Ichiba

Rakuten Shopping Marathons, held roughly twice a month, have a point cap of 7,000 points per event. This means the spending cap per event is 77,000 yen (tax included).

Additionally, if your spending during a single Shopping Marathon exceeds 77,000 yen, you may also hit the 55,000-yen cap for SPU-related bonuses, further reducing your overall discount rate.

However, even if some bonuses cap out, Shopping Marathons can still offer significant savings. Plan your purchases carefully based on your needs and budget.

## Maximize Rakuten Points with a Monthly Limit of 55,000 Yen (Tax Included)

As we've seen, the optimal way to maximize Rakuten Points is to limit your monthly spending to 55,000 yen (tax included). Beyond this amount, the advertised multipliers, such as "up to 46.5x" or "SPU up to 17.5x," will gradually lose their effectiveness.

Rakuten was once criticized for being more expensive than Amazon, even with points factored in. However, as Amazon shifts away from purely low-price strategies, Rakuten often becomes the cheaper option when points are included.

That said, this only holds true when point returns are maximized. If you exceed point caps and your effective return rate drops, your actual cost may end up higher. Be mindful of your monthly spending to fully benefit from Rakuten’s point system.
