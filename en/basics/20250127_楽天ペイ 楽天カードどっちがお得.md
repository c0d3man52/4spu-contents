## Differences in Point Return Rates: Rakuten Pay vs. Rakuten Card

Rakuten Pay and Rakuten Card offer different point return rates depending on how they are used. Here's a quick comparison based on the official guide:

[楽天ペイのチャージ払いでだれでも最大1.5％還元](https://pay.rakuten.co.jp/topics/pointprogram/)

1. **Rakuten Card Payments**: 1% point return.
2. **Rakuten Pay with Preloaded Rakuten Cash**: 1.5% point return.
3. **Rakuten Pay with Direct Rakuten Card Payments**: 1% point return.

If you don't preload Rakuten Cash, both Rakuten Pay and Rakuten Card will yield the same 1% return.

### Point Returns for Loading Rakuten Cash with Rakuten Card

As of **June 4, 2024**, changes were made to Rakuten Pay’s point system. Points are now awarded when Rakuten Cash is used, rather than when it is loaded.

1. **Before June 2024**:
   - 0.5% (1 point for every 200 yen) awarded upon loading Rakuten Cash via Rakuten Card.

2. **After June 2024**:
   - 0.5% awarded when Rakuten Cash is spent using Rakuten Pay.

Since Rakuten Cash earns 1% points upon use, the total return remains **1.5%**. The point allocation was simply shifted from the loading stage to the spending stage.

## Choosing Between Rakuten Pay and Rakuten Card

### Prioritize Rakuten Pay Whenever Both Are Accepted

In stores like convenience stores, supermarkets, and certain online shops where both Rakuten Pay and Rakuten Card are accepted, it’s better to use Rakuten Pay with preloaded Rakuten Cash. This approach increases your return rate by 0.5% compared to directly using Rakuten Card.

For Rakuten Card holders, it’s a good rule of thumb: *“If Rakuten Pay is an option, skip the card.”*

#### Exceptions: Rakuten Services

- Rakuten Pay is usable on **Rakuma**, but it isn’t accepted on **Rakuten Ichiba**, **Rakuten Books**, and most other Rakuten services.

### Rakuten Card Is Best for Rakuten Ichiba Purchases

Rakuten Card is the top choice for Rakuten Ichiba purchases since Rakuten Pay is not accepted on the platform. Here’s why:

- **Base Points (Rakuten Ichiba)**: 1%.
- **Rakuten Card Bonus**: +1%.
- **Special Days (0 & 5 Days)**: +1%.

This totals up to a **3% return**. Rakuten Pay wouldn’t be beneficial here even if it were accepted since Rakuten Card offers the best overall return.
