## Rakuten Point Returns Are Calculated Using "Four Key Numbers"

First and foremost, Rakuten Points are not simply calculated as "purchase amount × %." Without understanding the correct calculation method, you may mistakenly believe you'll receive more points than you actually will based on the displayed multiplier.

Rakuten Point returns are calculated based on "four key numbers":

1. The "pre-tax" payment amount
2. Points calculated in units of 100 or 200 yen (rounded down)
3. Point multiplier
4. Maximum point limits

The total points you actually receive are the result of these numbers multiplied together.

### The "Pre-Tax" Payment Amount

One commonly overlooked detail is that the points calculation is based on the "pre-tax" payment amount.

As of this writing, consumption tax rate in Japan is 10%, so the amount eligible for points is the total payment amount before the 10% tax is added. In simpler terms, roughly 90% of your total payment is eligible for points.

Therefore, the effective return rate you get from Rakuten's displayed multiplier is approximately 90% of the stated percentage.

### Points Calculated in Units of 100 or 200 Yen (Rounded Down)

Rakuten Points are not directly calculated as "pre-tax amount × %." Instead, points are calculated in units of 100 or 200 yen, with any remainder rounded down.

For example, with a pre-tax payment of 10,098 yen at a 1x multiplier, the calculation is based on 100-yen units, resulting in 100 points, with the remaining 98 yen excluded. For a 0.5x multiplier, calculations use 200-yen units, resulting in 50 points, again excluding the remaining 98 yen.

The calculation method is as follows:

1. For whole number multipliers: Divide the pre-tax amount by 100 and round down.
2. For fractional multipliers: Divide the pre-tax amount by 200 and round down.

### Point Multiplier

The point multiplier is applied after calculating the pre-tax amount. For more details on multipliers, refer to the following article:

It’s important to remember that multipliers are typically applied individually for each campaign or benefit. Thus, you cannot simply calculate points as "pre-tax amount × total multiplier."

Make sure to calculate points for each campaign individually.

### Maximum Point Limits

Each multiplier or campaign has a maximum point limit. For instance, the Rakuten Mobile member benefit of "+4x (4% extra)" has a monthly cap of 2,000 points.

Once you reach this cap, no additional points will be awarded, so the *effective return rate decreases as your purchase amount increases*.

For example, consider the Rakuten Mobile benefit:

1. For a pre-tax purchase of 10,000 yen: 400 points (4%)
2. For a pre-tax purchase of 100,000 yen: 2,000 points (2%)

The effective points return for a 100,000-yen purchase decreases because it reaches the 2,000-point cap.

In terms of effective return rate, for a 100,000-yen pre-tax purchase (110,000 yen including tax), the calculation is:

`2,000 ÷ 110,000 = 0.018`

This results in an effective return rate of 1.8%.

### Use Tools for Detailed Calculations

Rakuten's websites often do not display detailed calculations for these returns, so most users rely on "general impressions" or "the total displayed points" to understand the return.

However, when comparing prices with competitors like Amazon or local supermarkets, knowing "how much you're actually paying after returns" is crucial.

For accurate price comparisons, use tools like our "[Rakuten SPU Point Calculator](/tools/spu-calc/)" to fully understand your effective return rate before making a purchase. This ensures you’re making informed shopping decisions.
