## Rakuten Mobile-Related Point Boosts: Up to "+6x" Bonus

Rakuten Mobile offers additional point boosts for subscribers:

1. **Rakuten Saikyo Plan Subscription**: +4x
2. **Rakuten Mobile Carrier Payment (≥2,000 yen/month)**: +2x

The maximum combined bonus is "+6x," which equates to an effective return rate of 5.45% (since Rakuten Points are calculated on pre-tax amounts). The total point cap is 3,000 points per month.

### "Rakuten Saikyo Plan" Subscription: +4x (Cap: 2,000 Points/Month)

The primary benefit is the "+4x" point bonus for subscribing to the Rakuten Saikyo Plan. This is a signature offering that provides significant advantages to Rakuten Mobile users simply by maintaining their subscription.

However, the monthly cap is only 2,000 points, which limits the effective purchase threshold to *55,000 yen (tax included)*. This relatively low cap means that high-value purchases can quickly exceed the limit.

### Rakuten Mobile Carrier Payment: +2x (Cap: 1,000 Points/Month)

Another bonus comes from using Rakuten Mobile’s carrier payment service. If you spend at least 2,000 yen per month using this payment method, you earn a "+2x" point bonus.

This payment option applies to app purchases through the Google Play Store on devices supporting carrier billing. Unfortunately, it’s not compatible with Apple’s App Store, and the cap is set at just 1,000 points per month. This also translates to a *purchase threshold of 55,000 yen (tax included).*

While this condition may seem challenging for those who don’t frequently make app-related payments, it’s achievable if you use subscription services. By switching your subscription billing to Rakuten Mobile carrier payment, you can meet the requirement with ease.

Rakuten Mobile carrier payment can be added as a payment method for most apps and services compatible with Google Play Store payments. Check your subscriptions to see if you can use this method.

## One-Time Point Bonuses

### **Points for New Rakuten Mobile Contracts**

Rakuten Mobile often runs campaigns offering bonus points for first-time subscribers. While the exact number of points varies, recent campaigns have typically offered around 10,000 points. These points are easy to earn, as the only condition is being a first-time Rakuten Mobile subscriber.

Some promotions also provide additional points if you purchase a device along with your contract. Consider adding a device to your order for maximum benefits.

### **Exclusive Campaigns for Rakuten Mobile Users**

Rakuten Mobile periodically holds exclusive campaigns for its users, such as increased point return rates or discount coupons for Rakuten Ichiba (Rakuten Market).

These are usually one-off campaigns, so it’s essential to stay updated. Campaign details can be found on the Rakuten Link app.

### **Referral Program: Family & Friends**

Rakuten Mobile has a referral program that rewards both the referrer (current user) and the referee (new user).

- The referrer earns **7,000 points.**
- The referee earns **13,000 points (for MNP)** or **6,000 points (for new contracts).**

This program is always available, and during special campaigns, the referrer’s bonus may increase.

Introducing family members or a partner to Rakuten Mobile can be doubly rewarding since Rakuten Link allows free calls, adding further savings.
