## Types of Rakuten Points and Consumption Rules

Let's first take a look at the types of Rakuten points and the rules for consumption.

1. Regular Points: Valid for one year from the last earning.
2. Limited-Time Points: Expire at the end of the month in which they were granted, or the end of the following month.

In addition, Rakuten points generally follow the rule of consuming "limited-time points first."

This means that if "monthly point usage > limited-time points," the limited-time points will generally not expire.

### Points to Note

Rakuten's limited-time points vary in their issuance timing and expiration depending on the campaign. Therefore, even if "monthly point usage > limited-time points," limited-time points cannot be consumed for purchases made before they were granted.

To prevent such "missed uses," it is important to make sure that you use "points + cash" when making payments with Rakuten Pay or similar services.

## How to Prevent Expiration (1) Use Rakuten Pay Regularly

The best way to avoid expiration of Rakuten's limited-time points is to use Rakuten Pay for regular payments. Rakuten Pay allows you to make payments in physical stores, so you can treat Rakuten points like cash. Additionally, it is designed to consume points first, which is crucial.

Recently, major supermarkets and convenience stores have almost universally introduced Rakuten Pay, so using Rakuten Pay for daily shopping significantly reduces the chances of limited-time points expiring.

If your regular store does not support Rakuten Pay, consider switching to a store that does.

## How to Prevent Expiration (2) Make Regular Purchases During the Later Stages of Rakuten's Shopping Marathon

There may be certain items you buy online every month, such as daily necessities like rice and detergent, or consumables.

Rakuten conducts shopping marathons at least twice a month, so if you make these regular purchases during the later stages of the marathon and pay with limited-time points, you will ensure that your limited-time points are used up.

## How to Prevent Expiration (3) Switch to Rakuten Mobile for Your Mobile Line

Rakuten's limited-time points can also be used to pay for Rakuten Mobile charges. Rakuten Mobile charges range from 1,078 yen to 3,278 yen, and these fees are always consumed monthly.

Rakuten Mobile payments are typically due around the 11th of each month, ensuring that limited-time points are used.

## How to Prevent Expiration (4) Convert Points to Gift Cards

Rakuten Market sells gift cards such as Apple Gift Cards and Google Play Gift Cards, which can be purchased with Rakuten points. If you're used to making in-app purchases, converting your points to gift cards will allow you to use them without worrying about expiration dates, providing peace of mind.
