## What is Rakuten Magazine Lite?

Rakuten Magazine Lite is a new magazine subscription service that started in April 2025. It is a version of Rakuten Magazine with certain features limited and is available for free to specific users.

### Rakuten Magazine Lite Pricing

Rakuten Magazine Lite is completely free for eligible users. However, if you are not an eligible user, you cannot use Rakuten Magazine Lite at all.

### Eligible Users

Rakuten Magazine Lite is available for the following users:

1. **Rakuten Mobile strongest plan subscribers or new sign-ups:** "Rakuten Magazine Lite for Rakuten Mobile"[^1]
2. **Rakuten Black Card or Premium Card holders:** "Rakuten Magazine Lite for Rakuten Card"[^2]

Note that users with regular Rakuten Cards or MVNO Rakuten Mobile users are not eligible.

### Differences Between Rakuten Magazine Lite and Regular Rakuten Magazine

Let's take a look at the differences between Rakuten Magazine Lite and the regular Rakuten Magazine.

| Item                   | Rakuten Magazine Lite | Rakuten Magazine |
|:-----------------------|:---------------------:|:----------------:|
| Monthly Fee            | Free                  | ¥572 (tax included) |
| Subscription Period    | 7 days per ticket     | Unlimited       |
| Number of Tickets      | 3 per month           | Unlimited       |
| Number of Magazines    | Limited (about 1,000 titles) | Unlimited (about 10,000 titles) |
| Eligible Users         | Special users only    | All paid users  |
| Viewing Platform       | App only              | App, Browser    |

As shown, Rakuten Magazine Lite is a "limited free rental service" for specific magazines, whereas Rakuten Magazine is a "full magazine subscription service" allowing unlimited access.

For light users of magazine subscriptions, Rakuten Magazine Lite offers a highly cost-effective service. However, for those expecting the full magazine subscription experience, it may feel insufficient.

## Rakuten Mobile Users Can Subscribe to Rakuten Magazine at a Discount

Rakuten Mobile users can access Rakuten Magazine Lite for free but can also subscribe to Rakuten Magazine at a discounted price.

| Item                   | Regular Users        | Rakuten Mobile Users |
|:-----------------------|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|
| Monthly Payment        | ¥572 (tax included)   | ¥422 (tax included)   |
| Annual Payment         | ¥5,500 (tax included) | ¥4,070 (tax included) |

Rakuten Mobile users enjoy about a 25% discount, making the annual payment one of the most affordable prices for unlimited magazine subscriptions.

Since Rakuten Magazine Lite is a "free service for eligible users," if Rakuten Mobile users are not satisfied with Rakuten Magazine Lite, subscribing to the regular Rakuten Magazine at a special price is a much better cost-effective option.
